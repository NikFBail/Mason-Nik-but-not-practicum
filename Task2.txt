Finding time complexity of our algorithm

In this case n is equivalent to the number of letters we
    need to find the frequency of, which is also equivalent
    to the number of lines in the input file

We read through the input file once to get the total number of
    letters we need to find the frequency of, and then again
    to put them into a priority queue. (so n for each of those loops)

The while loop, 'while (priorQ.size() > 1)', goes through n - 1 times.

The method printCode is recursive, so idk we need to figure this out
